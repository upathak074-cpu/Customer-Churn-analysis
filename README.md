📌 Project Overview
Customer churn is an important business problem for subscription-based companies. Understanding why customers leave can help businesses identify high-risk customer groups and improve customer retention.

In this project, I performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a customer churn dataset using Python.

The analysis focuses on understanding how customer characteristics such as:

Tenure
Contract type
Senior-citizen status
Gender
Internet and other services
Payment method
Monthly charges
Total charges
are related to customer churn.

The main objective of this project is to transform raw customer data into meaningful insights through data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.

🎯 Project Objectives
The main objectives of this analysis are:

Understand the structure of the customer dataset.
Clean and prepare the data for analysis.
Identify missing or incorrect values.
Analyze the overall customer churn rate.
Compare churn across different customer groups.
Understand how tenure is related to churn.
Analyze the relationship between contract type and churn.
Study churn patterns across customer services.
Analyze churn according to payment methods.
Generate business insights from the visualizations.
Target Variable
The main target variable is:

Churn
It contains two categories:

Yes → Customer churned
No  → Customer stayed
🛠️ Technologies Used
The project was created using:

🐍 Python
🐼 Pandas
🔢 NumPy
📊 Matplotlib
📈 Seaborn
📓 Jupyter Notebook
🔄 Project Workflow
The project follows a simple data analytics workflow:

text Raw Dataset ↓ Data Loading ↓ Data Understanding ↓ Data Cleaning ↓ Data Transformation ↓ Exploratory Data Analysis ↓ Data Visualization ↓ Insight Generation
🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation
Before creating visualizations, the dataset was inspected using Pandas.

1. Loading the dataset
df = pd.read_csv("Customer Churn.csv")
The dataset contains:

7,043 rows
21 columns
2. Understanding the data
The following Pandas functions were used:

df.head()
df.info()
df.describe()
df.isnull().sum()
df.duplicated().sum()
These helped understand:

Dataset structure
Number of rows and columns
Data types
Missing values
Duplicate records
Numerical statistics
3. Handling TotalCharges
Initially, TotalCharges was stored as an object/string column.

Some records contained blank spaces.

The blanks were replaced with 0, and the column was converted to a numeric data type.

df["TotalCharges"] = df["TotalCharges"].replace(" ", 0)
df["TotalCharges"] = df["TotalCharges"].astype("float")
This made the column suitable for numerical analysis.

4. Converting SeniorCitizen
The original column contained:

0
1
For easier interpretation during analysis, these values were converted into:

0 → No
1 → Yes
This makes the visualizations easier to understand.

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis
1. Overall Customer Churn
The first visualization analyzes the distribution of customers who churned and customers who stayed.

Output
The dataset contains both:

Customers who stayed
Customers who churned
The overall churn rate is approximately 26.54%.

Knowledge gained
This provides a baseline understanding of the company's churn situation.

Approximately one out of every four customers in the dataset has churned, making customer retention an important area for further investigation.

2. Churn Distribution
A count plot was used to compare:

Churn = Yes
Churn = No
Knowledge gained
The visualization clearly shows that customers who stayed are considerably more numerous than customers who churned.

This also demonstrates why simply looking at the number of churned customers is not enough. It is useful to compare churn percentages across different customer groups.

3. Gender vs Churn
The analysis compares customer churn across:

Female customers
Male customers
Knowledge gained
The churn distribution between males and females is relatively similar.

This suggests that gender alone does not appear to be a major differentiating factor in the exploratory analysis.

Therefore, other variables such as contract, tenure, and payment method provide more useful areas for investigation.

4. Senior Citizen Analysis
The project analyzes the distribution of senior and non-senior customers.

It also compares churn across:

Senior Citizen = Yes
Senior Citizen = No
Knowledge gained
The analysis shows that senior-citizen customers form a smaller portion of the overall customer base, but their churn behavior differs from non-senior customers.

This indicates that customer age group can be useful when studying churn patterns.

However, this is an exploratory relationship and does not by itself establish that senior-citizen status causes churn.

5. Tenure vs Churn
tenure represents the number of months a customer has stayed with the company.

The analysis examines churn across different tenure levels.

Knowledge gained
A clear pattern appears in the analysis:

Customers with shorter tenure show higher churn.

As customers remain with the company for longer periods, churn generally becomes lower.

Business meaning
This suggests that the early stage of the customer relationship can be particularly important for retention.

A company could therefore pay special attention to new customers and monitor their satisfaction during their initial months.

6. Contract Type vs Churn
Customers are divided into:

Month-to-month
One year
Two year
The project compares churn among these contract types.

Knowledge gained
The analysis shows a strong difference in churn behavior between contract groups.

Customers with month-to-month contracts show substantially higher churn, while customers with longer-term contracts show lower churn.

Business meaning
Contract structure appears to be an important variable associated with customer retention.

This analysis can help a business understand which customer groups require greater retention attention.

7. Services vs Churn
The project analyzes several customer services, including:

Internet Service
Online Security
Online Backup
Device Protection
Tech Support
Streaming TV
Streaming Movies
Phone Service
Knowledge gained
Churn behavior varies across different service categories.

The analysis helps identify whether customers using particular services have noticeably different churn patterns.

For example, differences can be observed between customers using different internet service types and between customers with or without additional support/security services.

Business meaning
Service-level analysis can help a company investigate whether:

Certain services are associated with higher churn.
Customers with additional support services have different retention patterns.
Particular service groups need more customer-engagement strategies.
These plots show association, not causation.

8. Payment Method vs Churn
The project compares churn across different payment methods:

Electronic check
Mailed check
Bank transfer (automatic)
Credit card (automatic)
Knowledge gained
The analysis shows noticeable differences in churn across payment methods.

Customers using electronic check show a relatively high churn pattern compared with some other payment methods.

Business meaning
Payment method can therefore be considered an important variable for customer-retention analysis.

Businesses could investigate whether payment experience, convenience, billing preferences, or customer characteristics associated with particular payment methods are related to these differences.

💡 Key Insights
The exploratory analysis provides several important observations:

1. Overall churn
Approximately 26.54% of customers in the dataset have churned.

2. Tenure matters
Customers with shorter tenure show higher churn than customers who have stayed for longer periods.

3. Contract type is important
Month-to-month customers have noticeably higher churn compared with customers on longer-term contracts.

4. Payment method shows differences
Electronic-check customers show a relatively high churn pattern.

5. Gender has limited differentiation
Male and female customers show relatively similar churn distributions in this analysis.

6. Senior-citizen status shows differences
Churn behavior differs between senior and non-senior customers.

7. Services provide additional segmentation
Different internet and additional service categories show different churn patterns.

🧠 What I Learned From This Project
This project helped me practice the complete beginner-level data analytics process.

Python
I learned how to use Python for data analysis.

Pandas
I practiced:

python read_csv() head() info() describe() isnull() duplicated() groupby() agg() replace() astype()

Data Cleaning
I learned how to:

Detect missing values
Handle blank values
Change data types
Transform categorical values
Check duplicate records
Data Visualization
I practiced creating:

Count plots
Bar plots
Pie charts
Grouped visualizations
Churn comparisons
using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

Exploratory Data Analysis
Most importantly, I learned how to move from:

Raw Data ↓ Cleaning ↓ Visualization ↓ Pattern ↓ Insight

instead of simply creating charts without interpreting them.

🚀 Future Improvements
This project currently focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis.

Possible future improvements include:

Building a customer churn prediction model
Applying machine learning algorithms
Feature engineering
Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score
Creating an interactive Power BI dashboard
Developing a customer-risk segmentation system
Identifying high-risk customer profiles
⚠️ Important Note
The findings in this project are based on exploratory analysis. A relationship observed in a visualization does not necessarily mean that one variable causes customer churn. Further statistical analysis or machine-learning modeling would be required to investigate predictive relationships.
